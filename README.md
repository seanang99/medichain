# MediChain

## Project Description
MediChain is a blockchain project in the Insurance industry

## Technology Stack: 
- Frontend - React 
- Backend - NodeJS & ExpressJS
- Database - MongoDB
- Blockchain - Solidity (Ethereum)

## Frontend & Backend Dependencies
To run the application you must first install the following dependencies:

#### Parent Directory
```sh
npm install -g truffle ganache-cli
npm install web3 @truffle/contract
```

#### Frontend Directory
```sh
cd client
npm install web3 axios react-router-dom @material-ui/core @material-ui/lab @material-ui/icons
```

#### Backend Directory
```sh
cd Medichain_Backend
npm install express cors mongoose dotenv axios
```

```sh
cd EMRX_Backend
npm install express cors mongoose dotenv axios
```

## Application Startup Instructions
Open your Terminals and run these commands.
#### First Tab:
This starts the Ganache-CLI to start on Port 7545 with seed 8888. Ganache should generate 10 fixed test accounts automatically each with 100 ether by default.
```sh
ganache-cli -p 7545 -s 8888
```

#### Second Tab:
This will compile your contracts. You should see details of your contract being compiled and deployed in the command line. Ensure that the summary outputs the correct number of deployments. 
```sh
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

#### Third Tab:
This starts the backend MediChain node.js server. The app should be listening at http://localhost:3001. It should also show that "Medichain Mongoose DB Connection established Successfully!"
```sh
node Medichain_Backend/server.js
```

#### Fourth Tab:
This starts the backend EMRX node.js server. the app should be listening at http://localhost:3002. It should also show that "EMRX Mongoose DB Connection established Successfully!"
```sh
node EMRX_Backend/server.js
```

#### Fifth Tab:
This web interface for the web reactJS client can then be accessed at http://localhost:3000
```sh
cd client
npm start
```

#### Compulsory Initialisation
Before you start using the application, access the following links to initialise all the necessary accounts:
1. http://localhost:3001/medichainDbInit/dbInit
This will clear the MediChain database and initialise the following accounts:
##### Policyholder One
```sh
username: policyholder1
password: password
```
##### Insurer One
```sh
username: insurer1
password: password
```
##### Insurer Two
```sh
username: insurer2
password: password
```
    
2. http://localhost:3002/emrxDbInit/dbInit
This will clear the EMRX database and initialise the following account:

##### Medical Institute Personnel - Alex Ong
```sh
username: user1
password: password
```
#### Optional:
To run the test scripts for testing the MediChain smart contract.
```sh
truffle test
```

#### Important Note:
If you are running the application using NUS Wi-Fi, you may encounter problems with starting up the MongoDB database. Please kindly use your personal hotspot or personal Wi-Fi instead.
